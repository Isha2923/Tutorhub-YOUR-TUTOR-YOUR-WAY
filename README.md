## About Tutorhub
In the current educational landscape, students and parents often face challenges in finding qualified tutors tailored to their specific needs. The traditional methods of searching for tutors involve time-consuming research, limited access to diverse tutor options, and difficulties in scheduling demo sessions.
There is a need for a comprehensive Tutor Finder app that simplifies the process of connecting students with qualified educators, offering a diverse range of subject expertise, and transparent verification processes and addresses the common challenge that most students prefer to study offline because they cannot focus on studies without the help of a direct tutor.

## KEY FEATURES OF TUTORHUB -

Signup/Sign In: Users can create accounts or log in using secure authentication methods and verification mail is sent to new users once they create account in the app.
